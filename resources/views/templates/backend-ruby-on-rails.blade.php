                                <p>Ruby on Rails developers use the Ruby on Rails framework to build full-stack web applications. They leverage Rails' conventions, scaffolding, and built-in features to handle routing, database interactions, user authentication, and front-end integration. Ruby on Rails follows the principle of convention over configuration, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than repetitive tasks.</p>
